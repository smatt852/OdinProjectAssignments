The relevant files of the finished rps project are index.html and rpsUI.js.  
rps.js is the early basic idea from the first part of the assignment with console.logs for output.
Also check out the Sign Up Page Assignment, signUp.html. It checks that the passwords match and pops up a button to create an account.
